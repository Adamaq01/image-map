This is a simple Windows application that converts images to Minecraft maps using the latest colors. It works for Java Edition 1.12+ and Bedrock (inferior Windows 10 Edition).  

### How to Use
Click `Open`, then browse for any number of image files. For each image, you'll be able to change some import settings.
* **Scaling Mode** (defaults to "Automatic"): You usually don't want to touch this, but if your images are looking blurry or pixelated, try changing it.
* **Rotate Button**: Press this to rotate the image by 90 degrees clockwise.
* **Map Split**: Increasing these will split the images into many maps, and will show you how it will look when arranged in a grid.
* **Apply to All**: If this is checked, pressing confirm will skip this settings menu for all other images you imported and use the current settings for them. Pressing cancel will discard all other images you imported.

Once your images are imported, they'll appear as they will in-game as maps. Hover over an image to see the original. Check the "Bedrock Edition" box if you're exporting to Bedrock Edition. If you'e exporting to the normal Java Edition, leave it unchecked.

Click `Export`, and browse somewhere to save all the images as map files. To put them in your Java Minecraft world, save them to `.minecraft/saves/(your world)/data`. For Bedrock, you must browse to one of your world folders before saving.

Enter your world and a chest should be in your inventory containing your maps!

### Showcase
The following is a comparison of this program's map output compared to the most commonly used image-to-map program, [ImageToMapX](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-tools/1261738), which still uses pre-1.12 colors.
