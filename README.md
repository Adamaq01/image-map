## How to use
Click `Open`, then browse for any number of image files. Click `Export`, and browse somewhere to save all the images as maps. To put them in your Minecraft world, save them to `world/data`. If you're importing lots of pieces of a bigger picture, you can set the "Mosaic width." After exporting, a command will be copied to your clipboard. Paste it into a command block and power it to get all your maps quickly in the game at once.
