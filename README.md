## Image Map
This is a program that lets you convert images to Minecraft maps using the latest (1.12) colors.

## How to use
Click `Open`, then browse for any number of image files. Click `Export`, and browse somewhere to save all the images as maps. To put them in your Minecraft world, save them to `world/data`. If you're importing lots of pieces of a bigger picture, you can set the "Mosaic width." After exporting, a command will be generated. You can copy it to your clipboard, paste it into a command block, and power it to get all your maps quickly in the game at once.

## Showcase
The following is a comparison of this program's map output compared to the most commonly used image-to-map program, [ImageToMapX](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-tools/1261738), which still uses pre-1.12 colors.
