## Image Map
This is a program that lets you convert images to Minecraft maps using the latest (1.12) colors.

## How to use
Click `Open`, then browse for any number of image files. Click `Export`, and browse somewhere to save all the images as maps. To put them in your Minecraft world, save them to `world/data`.

When importing pixel art, set the `Scaling Mode` to `Pixel Art`. It will be imported using nearest neighbor interpolation to prevent blurriness. Otherwise, `Normal Image` will look best. When `Scale` is selected, images will be stretched to fit the Minecraft map size (128Ã—128). When `Split` is selected, imported images will be split into multiple maps. You can provide a width and height for each image.

## Showcase
The following is a comparison of this program's map output compared to the most commonly used image-to-map program, [ImageToMapX](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-tools/1261738), which still uses pre-1.12 colors.
